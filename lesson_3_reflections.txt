When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When working with a group, say a collaboration project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be files that we are working on which we might not want to
    pull or keeping some changes that away that we might want to work on
    seperately.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: It is used to clone/copy commit history and files/project from
           someone's gitHub to our's
    Clone: It is used to copy project from gitHub to local repository or
           from one local repository to other.
    Branch: Brances are created if one wants to parally on an experimental
            feature while keeping the original as it is. Branch names are labels.
