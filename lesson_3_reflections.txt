When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When working with a group, say a collaboration project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be files that we are working on which we might not want to
    pull or keeping some changes that away that we might want to work on
    seperately.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: It is used to clone/copy commit history and files/project from
           someone's gitHub to our's
    Clone: It is used to copy project from gitHub to local repository or
           from one local repository to other.
    Branch: Brances are created if one wants to parally on an experimental
            feature while keeping the original as it is. Branch names are labels.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can access the changes made to the remote without having internet access.
    Thus, enabling us to diff between the local and remote repositories.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using mails and other social media. Keeping track of files would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    While working with a group of people it would largely help when we make changes
    seperately and lets other too have a look on it to make them better and then finally
    adding everything up.
    Working directly on master keeps one always up-to-date.
    Working on branch on the other hand, would keep our main project free of
    bugs while we work on new experimental features.
